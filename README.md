# Freecam
This freecam script is a simple script that allows the user to enter a full freecam mode, the freecams movements are controlled by the mouse/controller movement and the W, A, S, D keys by default. The camera has a few developer tools built in including teleport to raycast / camera coord and coordinate viewer.

## Installation

Simply drag the `st_freecam` folder into your RedM resources folder and ensure it in you server.cfg

## Customisation

At the time of writing RedM does not yet have support for the CFX Keymapping as seen in FiveM. So the 2 options (You can add more if required) to access the freecam are a Page UP (default) keypress or command /freecam
